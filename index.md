Ellie Kurt is a dual master’s student in History and Library Science, her primary interest is in the place where history, literature, and memory meet. Ellie received her BA in History with minors in Political Science and Fine Arts from Roosevelt University. During her time at Roosevelt, Ellie participated in the Loundy Human Rights Project, interned at the Chicago History Museum, and served as a Newberry Library Undergraduate Fellow. Her Senior Thesis titled, “History Fictions” Curriculum and Pedagogy: An Exploration of Fact and Fiction Through Historical Narratives in Literature, explores how historians construct notions of truth by applying theories of cultural hegemony to curriculum design. Since beginning her MA, Ellie has interrogated the historiographic genre. In one case reading historical fiction as historiography, and in another inquiring into the role imperialism played in the professionalization of the field. Ellie’s work focuses on how cultural memory evolves and changes as it is reinterpreted for new purposes.
